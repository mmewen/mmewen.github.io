During a gap semester, I went to the Sino-European School of Technology of Shanghai University (UTSEUS), China to attend the "Language, Culture and Innovation for Entrepreneurship" program.
</p>

<p>
Courses were mainly taught by Shanghai entrepreneurs. They were about innovative project or start-up set-up process, intercultural understanding, presentation skills and an introduction to data science and IoT. Cultural courses were Mandarin knowledge and Chinese culture and professional world.
</p>

<p>
Companies linked projects gave me the opportunity to put courses into action. In particular, I organized, with two teammates, an analysis for Learning Tribes, an Acticall division, in which we applied project management. Additionally, as part of the entrepreneurship formation, student teams have designed a start-up project with the mentorship of Shanghai entrepreneurs (watch our presentation bellow). We have pitched our projects to a jury of professionals for a fake fund raising in a co-working space in the city center.

Finally, we went to China Silicon Valley Shenzhen to visit companies and understand the way this industrial region works.
