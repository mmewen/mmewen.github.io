At the age of 15, some friends of the youth council and I created a <a href='http://www.juniorassociation.org/' target='_blank'>Junior Association</a> "New Wave Radio". We broadcasted our own radio on FM and on the Internet with the help of Concarneau youth center.

I have been successively treasurer, presenter, journalist and technician of the radio.
