This challenge opposed two teams of ten students in the frame of the course "Smart machines" at the Compiègne University of Technology.
</p>
<p>
The aim was to make an autonomous Renault Zoé and a Bebop 2 Parrot drone collaborate. The car receives an obstacle alert as it is going in valet parking mode (autonomous low speed) on a road and stops. It asks the drone for help to analyse the road ahead and tell which is the free track. The Zoé moves off again autonomously when the answer is received.

I have been the integrator of the 'Aligot' team in this challenge. The following video (in French) details my contribution to the project.
