<h4>Student organizations websites</h4>
<p>
During the first student Hackathons organized in my university, I have worked on two websites.
</p>
<h5>Killerutc</h5>
<p>
The first one was dedicated to a giant 400 students "killer" game that were sadly aborted. Each of these players had to make a given player do a given action. If done, the "victim" would loose and the "killer" would get the "victim" goal.
</p>
<p>
This website manages the player list, the actions and the "murders". Another student and I coded it in PHP using a simple MVC framework.
</p>
<h5>Shwet</h5>
<p>
During the second Hackathon, I made the PHP back-end of a student service called "Shwet". Its aim is to gather documents for all the available courses to help future students. A colleague developed the front-end and it has been in production for 2 years now.

<h4>Static websites</h4>
<h5>mewen.fr and lapelledularge.fr</h5>
<p>
These GitHub Pages based websites are static and simple. Therefore, I sat up domain names and basic CSS, HTML and JavaScript (using jQuery).
