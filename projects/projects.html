I became accustomed to the main imaging pieces of software by regularly creating visual elements, videos or posters for different projects. 

LCI
During a gap semester, I went to the UTSEUS ("Université de Technologie Sino-EUropéenne de Shanghai"), China to attend the "Language, Culture and Innovation for Entrepreneurship" program. 
Courses were mainly taught by Shanghai entrepreneurs. They were about innovative project or start-up set-up process, intercultural understanding, presentation skills and an introduction to data science and IoT. Cultural courses were Mandarin knowledge and Chinese culture and professional world. 
Companies linked projects gave me the opportunity to put courses into action. In particular, I organized, with two teammates, an analysis for Learning Tribes, an Acticall division, in which we applied project management. Additionally, as part of the entrepreneurship formation, student teams have designed a start-up project with the mentorship of Shanghai entrepreneurs. We have pitched our projects to a jury of professionals for a fake fund raising in a co-working space in the city center. 
Finally, we went to China Silicon Valley Shenzhen to visit companies and understand the way this industrial region works.

Gyrobot
This small two wheels remote controlled robot has been a little challenge I tackled XXX in my free time. The idea was to conceive and build a machine -more or less- from scratch : web app on the phone, communication with the robot, actuators control, drawing and building the chassis XXX using fast prototyping techniques.
On the hardware side, a smartphone (the remote controller) connects to a hotspot spread XXX by a dongle plugged into a Raspberry Pi. This later hosts all the code and controls 2 Arduinos using USB. The sensors are gyroscope (used to keep the chassis horizontally) and a camera (unused for now). Actuators are simply two DC motors and lights. The whole thing is powered using a power bank for the moment. 
The software part is entirely in JavaScript : the main piece of software is in Nodejs XXX, the webapp uses jQuery, the communication goes through a Socket.io XXX websocket connection and the Arduino control uses Johnny Five XXX. This library communicates using the Firmata protocol which enables to manage the inputs and outputs of an Arduino. 


Ce petit robot à deux roues télécommandé par smartphone a été un petit défi pour occuper mon temps libre. L'idée était de concevoir et de fabriquer un engin de zéro : web app sur le téléphone, communication avec le robot, contrôle des actionneurs, fabrication et assemblage du châssis...
Du point de vue hardware, le smartphone se connecte au hotspot wifi émit par le dongle connecté à une Raspberry Pi. Celle-ci héberge la majorité du code et contrôle en USB 2 Arduinos. Les capteurs sont une webcam (inutilisée dans la première version) et un gyroscope (pour conserver une horizontalité du châssis). Les actionneurs sont deux moteurs à courant continu et un projecteur formé de LEDs. Le tout est alimenté par une batterie d'appoint de téléphone. 
Le logiciel est codé en Node.js, la webapp en JavaScript (avec jQuery), la communication est assurée via la librairie Socket.io et le contrôle de l'Arduino via la librairie Johnny Five. Elle utilise le protocole Firmata, dont le code Standard Firmata est téléversé sur l'Arduino.

Killerutc Shwet
During the first student Hackathons organized in my university, I have worked on two websites. The first one was dedicated to a giant 400 students "killer" game that were sadly aborted. Each of these players had to make a given player do a given action. If done, the "victim" would loose and the "killer" would get the "victim" goal.
This website manages the player list, the actions and the "murders". Another student and I coded it in PHP using XXX MVC framework.
During the second Hackathon, I made the PHP back-end of a student service called "Shwet". Its aim is to gather documents for all the available courses to help future students. A colleague developed the front-end and it has been in production for XX years now. 

Static websites
Mewen.fr lapelledularge.fr
These GitHub Pages based websites are static and simple. Besides, I sat up domain names XXX and basic CSS, HTML and JavaScript (using jQuery).

During my studies at the Compiègne University of Technology, I have been involved in many student projects. 
Durant mon cursus à l'Université de Technologie de Compiègne, je me suis investi dans plusieurs projets associatifs.
