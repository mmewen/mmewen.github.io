Nebul√¶ is a virtual reality experience, dedicated to dance, in which a universe of particles reacts to the user's gestures. It is possible to experiment modified non realistic physics and to express them on stars dust in order to propose a new experience to the dancer through his or her gestures.

This project is inspired by the PIXEL ballet, direction by the choreographer Mourad Merzouki and digital art by <a href="http://am-cb.net/en" target="_blank">Adrien Mondot and Claire Bardainne</a>, allowing a user to interact in real-time with particles.

Shifting from real world physic to virtual ones allow for a unique aesthetic experience. At the same time, the dancer visualizes the environment in a HTC Vive headset and the spectators can watch it in the Cave.
